# 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
# https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/
# Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, 
# construct and return the binary tree.


# Example 1:
# Input: preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
# Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

# Example 2:
# Input: preorder = [-1], inorder = [-1]
# Output: [-1]
 

# Constraints:
# 1 <= preorder.length <= 3000
# inorder.length == preorder.length
# -3000 <= preorder[i], inorder[i] <= 3000
# preorder and inorder consist of unique values.
# Each value of inorder also appears in preorder.
# preorder is guaranteed to be the preorder traversal of the tree.
# inorder is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.

# Definition for a binary tree node.

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        
class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not preorder and not inorder:
            return None
        
        root = TreeNode(preorder[0])
        mid = inorder.index(preorder[0])
        root.left = self.buildTree(preorder[1:mid + 1], inorder[:mid])
        root.right = self.buildTree(preorder[mid + 1:], inorder[mid + 1:])

        return root

# Complexity:
# T: O(N^2) In the worst case, the algorithm may visit each node in both the preorder and inorder traversal, 
#           leading to a quadratic time complexity. 
#           This occurs when the tree is skewed, 
#           and each recursive call involves iterating through a significant portion of the inorder list to find the root's position.
# S: O(N) No of nodes created for constructing the tree
