# 	136. Single Number

# Given a non-empty array of integers nums, 
# every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
# You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [2,2,1]
# Output: 1
# *********************************************************************************************/
# 	Logic:
# 	1. bitwise XOR (^) for 2 binary nos results in 0 for same bits and 1 for opposite bits
# 	2. here we intitialise the var with 0th index no from the array
# 	3. if nums[0] == 2 (var), nums[1] == 4 and nums[2] == 2
# 	4. when we XOR var to nums[1] we get 5 and when we XOR 6 with nums[2] (2) we get 4
# 	Example:  2 ^ 4 = 6 : 010 |   6 ^ 2 = 4 : 110
# 	                     100 |               010
# 	                     110 |               100
# 	5. The above step shows that we can do even occrances of a num will get cancelled out, 
# 	no matther where they occur in the list.
# 	Leaving no with only odd occurence in the variable var.
# 	Note: n ^ 0 = n (any no XOR 0 is always that no)


class SingleNumber:

	def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
		var = 0
		for n in nums:
			var = n ^ var
		return var

# Testing
instance = SingleNumber()
